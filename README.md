## 🌟 My ethic

Without sounding too cliché, I believe in a hard honest days work.

Fighting imposter syndrome has been a tough battle, but I heard someone once say, measure where you are, then 1 month later, measure again.
If you're happy with your progress, or if you think you're at least making any progress at all, then you have nothing to fear.

This has really resonated with me, and so I look forward to each new challenge (not in the way you might say on your CV, but with a genuine competitve desire to complete something you originally thought was out of your reach).
