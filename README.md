## 🌍 Explorer of the Great Outdoors

When I'm not knee-deep in code, you'll often find me out in the wilderness. I have a deep passion for exploring remote places, camping, and hiking with groups of adventurous friends. The digital world is amazing, but disconnecting and embracing the beauty of nature is equally important to me.
